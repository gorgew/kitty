# vim:ft=kitty
#: This is a template that can be used to create new kitty themes.
#: Theme files should start with a metadata block consisting of
#: lines beginning with ##. All metadata fields are optional.

## name: The name of the theme (if not present, derived from filename)
## author: The name of the theme author
## license: The license information
## upstream: A URL pointing to the location of this file upstream for auto-updates
## blurb: A description of this theme. This must be the
## last item in the metadata and can continue over multiple lines.

#: All the settings below are colors, which you can choose to modify, or use the
#: defaults. You can also add non-color based settings if needed but note that
#: these will not work with using kitty @ set-colors with this theme. For a
#: reference on what these settings do see https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/
